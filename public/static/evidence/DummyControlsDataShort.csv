ID.AM-3:  Organizational communication and data flows are mapped,"0806.01m2Organizational.12356
The organization’s network is logically and physically segmented with a defined security perimeter and a graduated set of controls, including subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are logically separated from the internal network, based on organizational requirements; traffic is controlled based on functionality required and classification of the data/systems based on a risk assessment and their respective security requirements.

Requirements for network routing control are based on the access control policy, including positive source and destination checking mechanisms, such as firewall validation of source/destination addresses, and the hiding of internal directory services and IP addresses. The organization designed and implemented network perimeters so that all outgoing network traffic to the Internet passes through at least one application layer filtering proxy server. The proxy supports decrypting network traffic, logging individual TCP sessions, blocking specific URLs, domain names, and IP addresses to implement a blacklist, and applying whitelists of allowed sites that can be accessed through the proxy while blocking all other sites. The organization forces outbound traffic to the Internet through an authenticated proxy server on the enterprise perimeter.
